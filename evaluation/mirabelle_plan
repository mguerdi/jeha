Run sledgehammer, collect all successful metis reconstructions in a database,
extend mirabelle with a "replay" mechanism where the ATPs don't need to be
called again.

Quick and dirty: Have mirabelle write out a version of the .thy where the proof
method calls have been inserted. (Like old-school mirabelle?)

Evaluation:

We use the replay feature as follows: If metis succeeds, try the same with
jeha. If metis fails, try with jeha.

This gives us a comparison of jeah performance against baseline metis and a the
cases in which jeha is better than metis.
